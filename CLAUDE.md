# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a chord analyzer project that appears to be in its initial setup phase. The repository currently contains only a basic README.md file.

## Current State

- Repository is initialized with git
- No source code files present yet
- No build configuration or dependency management files
- No test framework configured

## Development Setup

Since no specific technology stack has been chosen yet, future development will need to:

1. Determine the programming language and framework
2. Set up appropriate build tools and dependency management
3. Configure testing framework
4. Implement the chord analysis functionality

## Notes for Future Development

- The project name suggests this will be a music chord analysis tool
- Technology stack and architecture decisions are still to be made
- Consider what audio processing libraries or music theory frameworks might be needed
